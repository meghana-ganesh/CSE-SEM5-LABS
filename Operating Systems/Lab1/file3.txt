The error message "stack smashing detected" indicates that your program has encountered a buffer overflow or stack corruption issue, 
which has led to an abnormal termination of your program. 
This error usually occurs when you write more data into a buffer than it can hold, 
causing memory corruption.
In the code you've provided, 
I see that you have an array named line with a size of 256 characters. 
You're reading characters from the file into this buffer, 
and if the line length exceeds 256 characters, 
a buffer overflow can occur.
